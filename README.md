# Handin/submission LaTeX template
Light weight template for handing in school submissions using LaTeX. Suitable for math, physics, statistics and the like.
Here is the [handin-doc.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX/master/docs/handin-doc.pdf)
## Versions
The current latest version available on GitHub is v0.0.3 (2018/04/04) build 41

The current latest version available on CTAN is v0.0.3 (2018/04/04) build 41

*Be aware that it can take at least 24-48 hours from the CTAN date above until the package is updated on CTAN, TeXLive and MiKTeX are updated*

A build has no major changes in the core code (could be changes in documentation, or cosmetic changes in the code). Every time a minor version (that is the middle version number) changes, an upload is made to CTAN. If the patch version change (the last version number) is significant, it will also be uploaded to CTAN. The build number (ideally) never resets.

## Super quick start
### Texlive (MacOS and Linux): Only if you have texlive 2018
1. Install the package from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/handin). With `texlive`: `tlmgr install handin`
if you dont have texlive 2018, you can pretest it [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html): https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html
2. Add `\usepackage{handin}` to your preamble (that is any place before `\begin{document}`

### MikTeX (Windows):
It's already a part of MikTeX, so just do `\usepackage{handin}`

### And then
use the [docs](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/handin/handin-doc.pdf).

Since this package is in early stages, the CTAN-version is probably not the latest version though. There will be multiple builds pushed here first.

## Quickstart
`\usepackage{handin}`. However I reccomend checking out the example.tex in the quickstart:

Download the [example.zip](https://github.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/blob/master/example.zip?raw=true). It contains two files: [example.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/master/example.tex) and [handin.sty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/master/handin.sty). Build example.tex and you're all good to go.

## Example files
Look at the [example.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/master/example.pdf) generated by [example.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/master/example.tex) for an example that could be used at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.

## Dependencies
`inputenc,graphicx,lastpage,scrextend,fancyhdr,geometry,amsmath,mathtools,bm,esint,iflang`

## Internationalization
Currently using `iflang` to decide betwen norwegian and english.

## Quick docs:
### Commands
`\problem{1}` would create a *Problem 1* headline and `\pproblem{a}` would then print *1a)* subheadline (with some margin magic and other snacks). More functionality will be made, also feel free to request functionality.

### Front page (`\maketitle`)
[layout.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strauman/Handin-LaTeX-template/master/layout.pdf?raw=true) is an overview of what commands writes out what where. They are all used as commands to be set:
- `\title{Assignment title}`
- `\author{Author(s)}`
- `\coursename{TST-101}`
- `\coursetitle{Test course}`
- `\institute{Institute of Physics and Technology}`
- `\logo{path/to/logo/or/image}`
- `\pagetext{Page \thepage~of \pageref{LastPage}}`
- `\containspages{Contains \pageref{LastPage} pages, front page included}`

`pagetext` and `containspages` are set to the values you see above.

## Translations / Languages
As of now there are not much to translate. However it might expand as the package grows. Here are instructions on how to translate:

In the `src/languages/` folder and check out the other translations.
Copy and paste the `enUS.tex` file and translate.

If you feel up for integrating it, this is what you do:
1. In the top you should change the comment line in the top of your new language file
```
%:$LANGUAGES.=\!item English
```
to
```
%:$LANGUAGES.=\!item theNewLanguage (by \!href{https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername}{yourGitHubUsername})
```
2. Open the `src/languages/languagedelegator.tex` and add this line at the bottom
```
\IfLanguageName{ifLangName}{\input{languages/yourLang}}{}
```
where the `ifLangName` is the name of your language. This is what you have to enter in `babel` to get your language. Most likely it's the language name in the **native** language.

3. Add it in the comments with the other languages in `src/example.tex`.
