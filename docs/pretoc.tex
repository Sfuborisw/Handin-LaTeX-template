\section*{2 Problem}
I remember when I first started out with LaTeX, as a student, it was very new and challenging just to make a simple nicely typeset document. We've all seen documents that has problem numbering using sections, like I did here. (The header says \textbf{2 Problem}.)\\

This is a package that makes it easy for student to hand in a formatted document in LaTeX. It just creates a couple of commands that typesets the document with nice headers (problem numbers and part problem numbers e.g. \textbf{(1a)} ).\\

If you are a teacher, this package works just as well for creating exercises!\\
